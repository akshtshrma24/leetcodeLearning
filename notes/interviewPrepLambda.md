# Interview Prep Lambda

## What does lambda do

Lambda labs is the number one gpu cloud for ML/AI teams for training fine tuning and inferencing AI Models 
engineers can build test and deploy their models 

products = on premis gpus, publically and privately hosted gpus for AI researchers and ai companies world wide

AI developer cloud 

delivers the fastest network for distributed training
3200 gb/s nvidia quantum 2 infini-band networking 

only cloud specifically designed for Generative AI training and inference
complete data privacy and isolation 

established for 1 reason and 1 reason to tackle the challenge of teaching machines how to see and learn 


* 2012 Lambda launches ML facial recognition API 
* 2013 - 2016 Lambda establishes an internal GPU cloud for clients to support their AI image editing 
* 2017 Lamdba launches quad deep learning gpu workstation and lambda blade gpu server, worlds first plug play gpu super comp under 20k 
* 2018 lambda launches GPU cloud and lambda stack a comprehensive AI software repo
* 2021 gets funding from googles AI centric fund, shifts focus to GPU cloud 
* 2022 gets funding for first serious large scale GPU deployment
* 2023 more funding 
* 2024 lambda launches 1 click clusters, 
* 2025 more investment 
* 2026 hopes to go IPO and continue 

## are there competitors 

AWS, Google Cloud


## who are the founders
Michael Balaban and Stephen Balaban

## how is lambda different and similar than competitors 

both offer GPUs in the cloud for AI workflows but lambdalabs has unparalleled performance 

## Evan questions 

* How often do you guys interact with Nvidia 
* do you receive software to test the gpus from Nvidia ,
* how do you guys interpret test results from the GPUs
* how do you determine when a GPU is unhleathy, when GPUs are unhealthy waht is the rpeaier process do you pull it out does it stay in the rack 
* How do you use NVLINK, do you guys rent out space by the rack
* how do repairs work? 
* Do you guys have tools to track repairs? 
* do you guys keep the history of the server say im monitoring a server and taken out of server, is there a tool to track of the server was it bad before has it needed repair before 
* how do you guys monitor the fleet
* do you guys have ssh access to the servers if yes or no,
* what languages do you guys use besides Go and python, what tools do you guys use anectodadley 
* are the data centers entirely lambdas or do they rent out the datacenters 
* in the office do you guys have machines you can interact with directly or no


* Nvidia SMI, tells you what gpus plugged in and what not
