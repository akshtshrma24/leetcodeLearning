real end game

```py

class SparseVector:
    # Your SparseVector object will be instantiated and called as such:
    # v1 = SparseVector(nums1)
    # v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
    # ans = v1.dot_product(v2)
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        # do intialization here
        self.nums = nums
        

    # Return the dotProduct of two sparse vectors
    def dot_product(self, vec: "SparseVector") -> int:
        # write your code here
        total = 0
        for i in range(len(vec.nums)):
            total += self.nums[i] * vec.nums[i]
            
        return total
```

really easy as well wtf
