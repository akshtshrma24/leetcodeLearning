```py
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        array = [0] * (len(cost))
        array[0] = cost[0]
        array[1] = cost[1]
        for i in range(2, len(cost)):
            array[i] = min(array[i -1] + cost[i], cost[i] + array[i - 2])
        return min(array[-2], array[-1])
```

bottom up solution just goes through the cost arary and then takes the minimum lenght of the first one
and second one minimum gets added to the array, then it takes the minimum of the 2nd and 1st because
those both could be interchange able step wise
