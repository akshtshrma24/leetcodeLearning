Kind of Like the last one but im thinking you just append the first element to the end to show that it is the neihghbor
it was like the last one but the difference is that you cant just append it bc the first 2nd one can be robbed with the -1th
which is the circled back one so you have to run it with the first section [1:] and the second section [:-1] that way you 
get the 2 maximum
