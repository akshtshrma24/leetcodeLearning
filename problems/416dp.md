```py
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        target = sum(nums)
        if target % 2 == 1:
            return False
        
        dp = set()
        dp.add(0)

        target //= 2

        for n in nums:
            nextDP = set()
            for t in dp: 
                if target in dp: return True
                nextDP.add(t + n)
                nextDP.add(t)
            dp = nextDP

        return True if target in dp else False
```

basically if the sum is odd than you obviously cant be partitioned to equal eachother as theres no way to cleanly divide by 2 

so what u do is you do the dp route
you you go through it 
for every element in dp you want to add the current integer in it, if you have found it in dp return True
then copy it and put it in dp the reason you do this is becuase you are looping for every element in dp youd have an infinite loop otherwise
