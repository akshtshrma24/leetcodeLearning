class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[len(s)] = True

        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            for w in wordDict: 
                if(i + len(w)) <= len(s) and s[i: i + len(w)] == w:
                    dp[i] = dp[i + len(w)]
                if dp[i]: break
        
        return dp[0]
```
this one is also quite easy, 
basically we are going up to down

if our string is leetcode and our words are {leet, code}

basically we want to set the last dp to True as thats our base case

then we basically try if the word fits if it doesnt obviously dont set it to tru

if it does fit and it is equal then we set the dp[i] = to dp of the index + the word length
this makes sense because imagine our string is code and we have a worddict of code

basically our dp array looks like this 

[F,F,F,F,T]

we loop back unable to fit code in there until we get to to c 
we can fit and it matches
so we add the length to the index and set that dp value to the current dp value
which in this case is true so our array looks like

[T,F,F,F,T]

then we return the first value
