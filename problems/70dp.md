class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        print(dp)
        return dp[n]
```
Climbing stairs because the problem is either the solution of 1 before or 2 before it due to the
problems constraints, dp is starting to make sense
