```py
class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        l = 0
        r = len(arr) - 1

        while (r - l + 1) > k: 
            if(abs(arr[r] - x) >= abs(arr[l] - x)):
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1
        
        return arr[l:r + 1]
```
this one is quite easy 
make 2 points and find the section of K elements where the difference is smallest, you would do this by 
checking if the right sides - x is greater than the left sides x then decrease from right side
otherwise u want it to be bigger so u increase from left side

then once the window becomes k size it breaks and you have the l and the r so you return the window
